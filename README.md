# Discord BOT

Requirement:

- NodeJS V17 (At least I tested this version and I can say that it works perfectly, but newer versions of NodeJS can also work)

- Installing the additional discord.js node package.

- Creating an application on https://discord.com/developers/applications, and inside the application you will need to create a bot from the "BOT" section, where you will generate a token for the bot.

------------------------------------------------

This bot was created by me using the documentation from https://discord.js.org/ I hope you like it!
